# Assignment from The Iron Yard, Front End Engineering (Durham)
## Fall 2016

"You will be creating a TODO list application that will operate according the specifications below. The HTML and initial Sass structure is given to you, although you will need to finish out the styles (but don't spend too much time on that, the focus should be the functionality in JS)."

1. You must add styles to the Sass files, but this should be secondary to the JavaScript  
2. Try to create your JS code to handle DATA separately from the presentation (HTML).  
3. ou many only use ONE global variable (a namespace [see the Dice Game for an example]) and NO OTHERS.  
4. Your TODO items should be stored in JavaScript in an array, with each item being an object. (Don't worry about permanent storage, unless you do EPIC mode.)
